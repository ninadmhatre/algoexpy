I was brushing up my knowledge on these algorithms and had to refer few things on internet that when i felt what if i never have to leave the terminal (idle) to learn something? Currently there are very few algorithms in module but i will add more soon. Anyone interested please check the \"Contribute\" section below\r\n\r\nI thank, \r\n- Author of [basic-sorting-algorithms-implemented-in-python](http://danishmujeeb.com/blog/2014/01/basic-sorting-algorithms-implemented-in-python) blog post which inspired me to write this module\r\n- Interactivepython.org for superb course on Algorithms & data structures \r\n\r\nSo here are some of the basic algorithms, data structures and if i manage to finish both then i might add some common puzzles for e.g. pascals triangle\r\n\r\nPlease refer [pylrn wiki](https://github.com/ninadmhatre/pylrn/wiki) for more information\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n========\r\n\r\nSole purpose of this module is for \"educational\" purpose and its intended to be used via \"idle\"\r\n\r\n[Design & Usage](https://github.com/ninadmhatre/pylrn/wiki/Usage)\r\n========\r\n\r\n1. I have used addon framework, which allows anyone can write these algorithms even user and load them from idle\r\n2. Every addon must have below methods\r\n   - execute      : Wrapper around \"logic\" [Please see one of the addons to understand] \r\n   - info         : Information about the algorithm [As of now, its first para from Wiki and Big-O notations]\r\n   - logic        : Any Guesses? [You can have logic in sub modules]\r\n   - info_online  : Opens the default browser with link to Wiki article [No need to google]\r\n   - show_code    : Print source(logic) on idle console [Supports printing multiple methods]\r\n   - \\__addon\\__    : Name of addons [if you are using addon_generator.py, this will be there]\r\n3. Intended to be used via \"Idle\"\r\n4. Use \"Debug\" mode in idle to understand more about the code [add debugger on \"execute\"]\r\n\r\nPlease refer [usage wiki](https://github.com/ninadmhatre/pylrn/wiki/Usage) for more information\r\n\r\n[Contribute](https://github.com/ninadmhatre/pylrn/wiki/Want-To-Contribute)\r\n=====\r\n\r\nPlease refer [contribute page](https://github.com/ninadmhatre/pylrn/wiki/Want-To-Contribute) for more information.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n=====\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is any issue with poor/wrong implementation of algorithms.\r\n","google":"UA-58098399-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
